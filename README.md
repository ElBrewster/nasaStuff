## Purpose
This app displays photos from one of the publicly available NASA APIs. My goal for it from the start has been to work with data I enjoy, and to focus primarily on the Express.js web application framework. Most courses and walkthroughs that I have encountered for Node.js fullstack software projects (such as PERN, MERN, and MEAN) rush through the Express portion, and I felt I was missing out on a more in-depth understanding of this middleware. I also wanted more experience with the http request and response cycle, and a more thorough understanding of Express's file structure in `routes/views` for creating routes on a site or for creating API paths.

Robert Bunch's [course](https://gale.udemy.com/course/just-express-with-a-bunch-of-node-and-http-in-detail/learn/lecture/11301584#overview) "Just Express (with a bunch of node and http). In detail." was instrumental in helping me create this.
